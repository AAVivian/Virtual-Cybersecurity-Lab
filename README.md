# Virtual-Cybersecurity-Lab
A 3-part cybersecurity project: Building a Virtual Cyber Security Lab, Conducting Android Forensics and Deploying a Firewall to Stimulate an enterprise-grade network Security Environment.
## Part I Virtual Networking
### üéØ Objective
To configure a virtual network between two VirtualBox virtual machines ‚Äî Kali Linux and Windows 10 ‚Äî for secure, isolated communication and penetration testing simulations.

### üíæ Software Used
Oracle VirtualBox 7.1.10
Kali Linux 2025.2 (VirtualBox Image)
Windows 10 ISO or preinstalled image
VC_redist.x64 (to resolve .DLL dependencies)

### üåê Virtual Network Configuration Steps
#### üì° Step 1: VirtualBox Network Setup
Each VM was configured with one network adapter:
Adapter 1: Internal Network (intnet, for VM-to-VM communication only)
The adapter used Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop adapter type with Promiscuous Mode set to Deny.

#### üîó Step 2: IP Address Assignment

Virtual Machine	Interface	IP Address	Network Adapter
*Kali Linux	eth0	192.168.56.30/24	Internal Network*
*Windows 10	Ethernet	192.168.56.40/24	Internal Network*
			
‚úÖ On Kali Linux Terminal:
*sudo ip addr flush dev eth0*
*sudo ip addr add 192.168.56.30/24 dev eth0*
*sudo ip link set eth0 up*
‚úÖ On Windows 10:
Open ncpa.cpl
Right-click the Ethernet adapter
*Set static IP to 192.168.56.40*
*Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0*
*No default gateway needed*

### üîó Connectivity Verification
‚úÖ Ping from Kali to Windows:
ping 192.168.56.30

Result: Successful with response times indicating both VMs are connected.
‚úÖ Ping from Windows to Kali:
*Using cmd ‚Üí ping 192.168.56.40*
Result: Successful.

‚úÖ Nmap Scan from Kali:
*nmap 192.168.56.30*
*I scanned the IP address 192.168.56.30, and Nmap responded with:*

All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.56.30 are in ignored states.
Not shown: 1000 closed tcp ports (reset)

## üóíÔ∏è Part II - Android Forensics Investigation
This section of the project demonstrates foundational mobile device forensics using a sample forensoc image. The analysis was conducted using Autopsy.
### üîç Objectives:
Extracted and analyze:
	- SMS messages
 	- Call logs
  	- Contact lists
   	- Application usage
    	- Deleted files and browser history
     - Generate a formal forensics report with:
     	- Methodology
      	- Screenshots of findings
       	- Key evidence and recommendations

This PDF contains all evidence, screenshots and professional conclusions from the forensic analysis.

## Part III - Virtual Firewall Implementation
this repository contains the setup and configuration steps for simulating a basic enterprise firewall environment using **pfSense** within a virtual lab.
## üß∞ Tool Used
	- **VirtualBox** - for virtualizzation
 	- **pfSense ISO** - for firewall deployment
  	- **Kali Linux** (Attacker VM)
   	- **Windows 10** (Target VM)
## üèµ Setup Overview
- Installed pfSense as a virtual appliance
- Configured: -**WAN Interface** : NAT - **LAN Interface**: Internal Network
- Connected to Kali and Windows to the pfSense LAN
- Verified internal connectivity (ping)
- Applied basic firewall rules to allow/block specific ports
## üîç Key Highlights
- Successfully routed all traffic through pfSense
- Block ports to test rule enforcement
- Captured denied traffic logs for validation
